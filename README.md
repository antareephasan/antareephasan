👋 Hi there, I'm Antareep Hasan!

🎓 I'm an undergraduate student pursuing a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Global Village.

💻 I'm passionate about programming and problem-solving, and I'm on a journey to explore the endless possibilities of the tech world.

🚀 I specialize in JavaScript and have hands-on experience with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. Currently, I'm diving deep into Next.js and also have an interest in Three.js for creating exciting web experiences.

👨‍💻 My tech stack includes:
   - JavaScript
   - React.js
   - Node.js
   - MongoDB
   - Mongoose
   - C / C++
   - Python
   - Next.js
   - Prisma
   - GraphQL
   - MySQL

🎸 When I'm not coding, you can find me strumming my acoustic guitar and losing myself in the world of music.

📫 Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects! Feel free to reach out to me here or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antareep-hasan/), and let's create something awesome together.
